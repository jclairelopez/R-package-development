# Why make a package?
# test, generalize, document, share

install.packages("usethis")

# Create a package on your desktop
#usethis::create_package("~/Desktop/mypackage")

# Create package in RStudio.cloud (within the main project)
usethis::create_package("mypackage")

# can use build tools from within an active project: testing, checking, building source, etc.
